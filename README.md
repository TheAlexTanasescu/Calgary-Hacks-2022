Evolve to the best version of yourself by building healthy habits, hand in hand with your pets.

A healthy lifestyle gamified app of which the objective is to set and maintain healthy habits. Players are the rewarded with points and tokens, the longer they maintain a certain habit. Players can use these tokens and points to either buy new pets in addition to the one they're given at the start of the game or to evolve their current pet. Battles occur when player wish to take over an adjacent territory. The victor of battles between players are determined through the rolling of dice. The amount of dice rolled depends on the number of pieces on a territory. The player with a higher number pieces on a territory has a higher chance defending/attacking territories, but is not guaranteed to win the battle. Thus adding the element of risk.
